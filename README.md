# sentiment-analysis: TITLE HERE

Version 1.0.0

Description
---------------
The purpose of this project to perform a sentiment analysis on newspaper headlines related to immigration.

## Background
Newspapers are notoriously biased and research suggests that readers prefer news sources that affirm their beliefs and political leanings. This would suggest that news coverage, especially from more biased news sources, is not neutral. We were interested in verifying this by analyzing the sentiment of headlines covering a politically charged topic in the US: immigration. 

## Data
News headlines from September through October of 2020 were collected using the News API. We chose news domains that are also included in the Pew Research Center's political bias evaluation since we plan to evaluate the relationship between political bias and sentiment (CITATION HERE). 

#### Domains Included
DOMAINS HERE

We then evaluated the News on the Web Corpus for words related to immigration that occur frequently (CITATION HERE). We chose seven keywords: immigration, immigrant(s), migrant(s), and refugee(s).
